      The People In Tech podcast was started by Caleb King in 2018 with the idea of breaking town technology topics in a manner all can interpret and understand.
      Targeted towards people in tech, people interested in getting into tech or who are just interested in the specific topic we address. I started the podcast
      as a fun project but with the growth of our listeners also known as "Day1 Listeners" we have created a community where all tech related questions can be asked
      without any judgement. Our motto is, "We are here for you". For the people, by the people delivered to the people. Join the conversation!
